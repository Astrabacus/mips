## Simple Summary
本文将基于对社会角色、社会地位与声誉的相关理论来阐述元界数字身份声誉系统的理论基础和模型设计。


## Specification



TODO...

## Rationale
To be written.

## Backwards Compatibility
Existed deposit transactions is valid always, however, if this MIP done, system DO NOT accept old type deposit transaction any more.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for MIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other MIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any MIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the MIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
